Grades = (input("Please insert the grades you got:"))
#I ask for the grades with an input function and save it to the "Grades" variable.
print("The inseted grades are" + str(Grades))
#I print the grades I saved in the variable "Grades" to check which grades I put in and check if they're correct.
##(I think I will add a "Are these grades correct" correct later)
Splited_Grades = Grades.split()
#I split my list so I can work with it.
##[If I don't split the list the next step won't count how many element the list has correctly]

Amount_Of_Elements_In_The_Grades_List = len(Splited_Grades)
print("The amount of grades inserted is:" + str(Amount_Of_Elements_In_The_Grades_List))
#I count the quantity of elements in the list saved in the "Splitted_Grades variable" 
## Just so I can divide the Summ of grades by the amount of grades we're working with.
###Then print it to visualize how many elements it has. 

Integer_List = list(map(int, Splited_Grades))
#I convert the "Splitted_Grades" list elements into integers to be able to add them
Summ_Of_Grades = sum(Integer_List)
#Then I add the grades.
print("The summ of grades is:" + str(Summ_Of_Grades))
#I print the summ to visualize what amount the summ gave me.

Average = Summ_Of_Grades/Amount_Of_Elements_In_The_Grades_List
print("Your average is:" + str(Average))
#I calculate the average and print it to be read in the terminal. And here's our result.
